## RISC-V Architecture

The RISC-V architecture is built on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) and is notable for being open-source, allowing anyone to design and implement a RISC-V CPU without paying licensing fees. This openness has created a collaborative environment, enabling contributions from a wide range of organizations, including both startups and industry leaders like Google and Intel.

A key characteristic of RISC-V is its modular design. The architecture includes a mandatory base ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) that can be extended with various optional components, allowing for customization based on specific application needs. For example, the RV32IMAC designation refers to a 32-bit CPU featuring the base integer ISA along with extensions for multiplication, atomic operations, and compressed instructions. This modularity enables developers to create CPUs that balance performance, power consumption, and complexity according to their requirements.

RISC-V is gaining widespread adoption across diverse industries such as cloud computing, automotive, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Companies are increasingly leveraging RISC-V to design custom chips optimized for specific tasks, like artificial intelligence and data processing. The architecture's adaptability and scalability make it ideal for a variety of devices, from high-performance servers to energy-efficient embedded systems. The RISC-V International organization, a nonprofit, governs the development and standardization of the RISC-V ISA. This group ensures that the architecture evolves with a focus on community-driven innovation rather than commercial interests, further solidifying its popularity within the tech community.

## Bridging Software Applications and Hardware

In everyday use, we interact with application software (apps) to control hardware devices. This interaction happens like this, Between the application software and the hardware, there is an intermediary layer known as system software. This layer acts as a bridge, converting application requests into a format that hardware can interpret, specifically binary language.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9ec542f-278d-43fc-9428-095b3e4a264b)

- **Operating System (OS)**: The OS manages fundamental tasks such as input/output operations, memory management, and system-level functions. It also plays a crucial role in translating application software into machine-readable code in languages like C, C++, or Java.

- **Compiler**: The compiler processes the code generated by the OS and translates it into machine code or executable files (e.g., .exe files). This code is specifically designed to be executed on the hardware platform in use.

- **Assembler**: The assembler further converts these executable files into binary code. This binary code is the language that the hardware can interpret and execute to perform the required tasks.

# Overview of IC Design Elements and Terminology

## Core

The core is the central section of an integrated circuit (IC) where the essential logic functions are executed. It encompasses all combinational circuits as well as both soft and hard intellectual property (IP) blocks.

## Die

A die is the individual unit of semiconductor material that houses the core and the input/output (IO) pads. Multiple dies are manufactured on a single silicon wafer to optimize production efficiency.

## IO Pads

IO pads are the interface points that enable communication between the chip's core and the external environment. These pads include input, output, and power pads, facilitating the connection of the chip to other components.

## Intellectual Property (IP)

Foundry IPs are pre-designed circuit modules that can be reused across various designs. These may include elements like SRAM, ADCs, DACs, and PLLs, which often require custom design or human expertise.

## Process Design Kits (PDKs)

Process Design Kits (PDKs) act as a crucial link between design engineers and semiconductor fabrication plants. They contain essential files that model fabrication processes, including device models, design rule checks (DRC), layout versus schematic (LVS) checks, and standard cell libraries. For example, the SkyWater 130nm PDK is frequently used in IC design workshops.



# Overview of the RTL to GDSII Flow

The RTL to GDSII flow in VLSI design transforms an RTL (Register Transfer Level) description of a digital circuit into a physical layout prepared for manufacturing. This process includes several stages: RTL synthesis, floor planning, placement, routing, and ultimately generating the GDSII file format, which holds the layout data. Each stage ensures that the final integrated circuit (IC) layout accurately represents the intended functionality and adheres to fabrication standards.

## Specification and RTL Coding

The design process starts with a specification provided by the customer, detailing the required functionality of the chip. This specification is then converted into Register Transfer Level (RTL) code using Hardware Description Languages (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL.

## Simulation and Verification

Once the RTL coding is complete, the design undergoes simulation to verify its functionality. This step ensures that the design operates as intended before moving to the next stage. Verification engineers thoroughly test the RTL code to identify and correct any bugs, ensuring the design's accuracy.

## Logic Synthesis

After successful verification, the RTL code is synthesized into a gate-level netlist. This involves translating the high-level design into an optimized format that can be implemented using standard cells from a technology library. Logic Equivalence Checking (LEC) is performed to confirm that the synthesized design retains the functionality of the original RTL code.

## Physical Design (Place and Route)

The physical design phase follows, encompassing floorplanning, placement, and routing of the netlist. This stage focuses on organizing the components on the silicon die, optimizing for area, and maintaining signal integrity. The final product of this phase is a GDSII file, the industry-standard format for layout data.

## Signoff and Tapeout

Before the design is sent for fabrication, it undergoes several signoff checks to ensure it meets all specifications and design rules. This final verification step is crucial for identifying any critical errors. Upon approval, the GDSII file is sent for fabrication, marking the tapeout phase and the completion of the design process.

## Day 2

## FloorPlan and Placement

### Chip Floorplanning Considerations

### Utilization Factor and Aspect Ratio

To determine the Utilization Factor and Aspect Ratio, we first need to understand how to define the height and width of the core and die areas.

- **Core**: The core area of a chip is where all the logic cells and components are placed. It is essentially the functional part of the chip.

- **Die**: The die area surrounds the core and is used for placing I/O-related components.

The dimensions of the core area are determined by the netlist of the design, which specifies the number and types of components needed. The height and width of the die area depend on the core area’s dimensions.

For example, if a netlist includes two logic gates and two flip-flops, each with an area of 1 square unit, the netlist comprises four elements. Therefore, the minimum total area required for the core will be 4 square units.

### Utilization Factor

The Utilization Factor is defined as the ratio of the core area occupied by the netlist to the total core area. For an effective floor plan, the Utilization Factor should be less than 1. A Utilization Factor of 1 indicates that the core area is fully utilized, leaving no room for additional logic, which is typically undesirable.

`Utilization Factor = (Area occupied by netlist / Total core area)`

### Aspect Ratio

The Aspect Ratio is the ratio of the core's height to its width. An Aspect Ratio of 1 signifies that the core is square-shaped, while a ratio other than 1 indicates a rectangular core.

`Aspect Ratio = (Height of the core / Width of the core)`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa393d9b-ec3d-4060-bfe8-162736a9e373)

In this example, the calculations are as follows:

- **Utilization Factor**: (4 squnits)/(4 squnits) = 1

- **Aspect Ratio**: (2 units)/(2 units) = 1

   *Note: The core is square in shape.*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30016e8a-fc19-438d-8943-91b6834e2919)

In this example, the calculations are as follows:

- **Utilization Factor**: (4 squnits)/(8 squnits) = 0.5

- **Aspect Ratio**: (2 units)/(4 units) = 0.5

   *Note: The core is rectangular in shape.*

## Flowchart for running floorplan in OpenLane

### Floorplan Configuration

To ensure the floorplan runs smoothly, designers need to manage specific settings that impact the floorplan's configuration. For instance, parameters like the utilization factor and aspect ratio are critical switches that affect the floorplan. It is essential for designers to verify these settings before initializing the floorplan to ensure they align with the project's requirements. The image below illustrates the various switches available during the floorplan stage.

To run the floorplan process, execute the following command:

    run_floorplan

![Screenshot 2024-08-29 184258](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84e3469a-35f6-4809-b4e0-959b71423829)

## Placement

Placement is a critical step in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design, involving the assignment of physical positions to standard cells or logic elements within a chip or block. Here’s an overview:

1. **Global Placement:**
   - In this phase, general positions are assigned to movable objects (cells).
   - Some overlap between objects is permissible at this stage.
   - The objective is to create an approximate layout that meets area requirements.

2. **Detailed Placement:**
   - This phase refines the positions established during global placement.
   - It ensures that no overlaps occur and that cells are placed on valid sites.
   - The quality of detailed placement is crucial as it affects the efficiency of the subsequent routing process.

### Process Design Kits (PDKs)

A Process Design Kit (PDK) is a detailed collection of files provided by semiconductor foundries that outlines the fabrication process for integrated circuits. These kits are essential for the design process, offering technology-specific details that designers use to create, simulate, and verify their designs before moving to manufacturing. PDKs are crucial for ensuring that designs are feasible for production and meet performance standards. A precise PDK significantly enhances the chances of first-pass success in silicon fabrication, which is key to minimizing time-to-market and development costs.

### Key Components of PDKs

- **Device Libraries**: PDKs include libraries of primitive devices such as transistors, capacitors, resistors, and other essential components for circuit design.
  
- **Design Rules**: They provide design rule checking (DRC) guidelines to ensure that the layout meets the manufacturing capabilities of the foundry. This includes requirements for minimum feature sizes, spacing, and other geometric constraints.
  
- **PCells**: Parameterized cells (PCells) are part of PDKs, enabling designers to create complex layouts that automatically adjust according to specified parameters.
  
- **Verification Tools**: PDKs include verification tools like LVS (Layout Versus Schematic) to ensure that the layout matches the schematic.
  
- **Modeling and Simulation**: PDKs contain simulation models (e.g., SPICE models) that predict the behavior of the designed circuits under different conditions.
  
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is provided to assist designers in using the PDK, including design rule manuals and technology data.

### Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) Rules

### Design Rule Check (DRC)

Design Rule Check (DRC) is a crucial verification stage in the circuit design process. It ensures that the physical layout of the circuit adheres to the manufacturing constraints specified in the Process Design Kit (PDK). DRC rules help identify potential issues such as:

- Minimum spacing between components
- Widths of metal lines
- Area requirements for specific features

By applying DRC rules, designers can detect and correct errors early in the design process, thereby avoiding expensive modifications and revisions later on.

### Layout vs. Schematic (LVS)

Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) is a crucial verification step that ensures the circuit layout aligns with the original schematic design. The LVS process involves:

- Comparing the netlist derived from the layout with the netlist from the schematic.
- Verifying that all connections and components are accurately represented in both the layout and the schematic.

LVS is essential for confirming that the final design will operate as intended once fabricated, thereby reducing the risk of functional failures in the manufactured chips.


## Placement Configuration in OpenLane

Placement configuration in OpenLane requires setting parameters that define how design elements are positioned within the chip layout. Important parameters include target density, maximum allowable displacement for cell placement, and configurations for macro placement. These settings are crucial for optimizing the layout to enhance both performance and area efficiency.

To run the placement process, execute the following command:

    run_placement

![Screenshot 2024-08-30 093108](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e9448a7-a1bf-4aff-bf15-f60df313c7a5)

## Day 3

## Design library cell using Magic Layout and ngspice characterization

### Creating a Standard Cell Layout

1. **Design the Inverter Layout:**
   - Utilize a layout tool (such as MAGIC) to draft the inverter layout.
   - Adhere to process-specific design rules and guidelines.
   - Position standard cells (transistors, metal layers, etc.) according to the logical schematic.

2. **Extraction Process:**
   - After completing the layout, extract parasitic capacitances and resistances.
   - In the `tkcon` window, run the command `extract all`.
   - This action generates an extracted file containing parasitic details (e.g., capacitances, interconnect resistance).
   - The extracted file will be saved in the `vsdstdcelldesign` directory.

3. **SPICE Netlist:**
   - Use the extracted data to assemble a SPICE-compatible netlist (typically in `.sp` or `.cir` format).
   - Incorporate transistor models, capacitances, and resistances.
   - This netlist will be used for simulations in tools like ngspice.

### Introduction to LEF Files in VLSI Design

LEF (Library Exchange Format) files are crucial for interfacing between layout tools and place-and-route (PnR) tools in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design.

#### Purpose of LEF Files

- **Layout Abstraction:**
  - LEF files provide an abstract representation of a block, such as a macro or a standard cell, containing only the essential details required for PnR tools.
- **Essential Information:**
  - Instead of the entire layout, PnR tools need minimal information, including the PR boundary (bounding box) and pin positions.

## LEF Files

### Technology LEF
Contains details about the metal layers, vias, and DRC (Design Rule Check) technology used by the placer and router.

### Cell LEF
Provides an abstract view of the cell, including information about the placement and routing (PR) boundary, pin positions, and metal layer details.

## Day 4

## Pre-Layout STA and Clock Tree Synthesis

In this session, we'll delve into timing modeling with delay tables and the process of translating grid information into track information. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Timing Modeling with Delay Tables

1. **Delay Tables:**
   - Delay tables provide crucial data on signal delays (propagation times) through various components like gates, wires, and interconnects.
   - These tables are essential for estimating signal arrival times, ensuring proper timing throughout the design.

2. **Application:**
   - During physical design, delay tables are used to model the timing behavior of standard cells, macros, and other components.
   - They guide placement and routing tools to optimize signal paths and achieve timing closure.

### Converting Grid Information to Track Information

1. **Objective:**
   - The conversion of grid information (rows and columns) into track information is a key step in physical design.
   - Tracks represent predefined horizontal and vertical routing paths on each metal layer.

2. **Design Considerations:**
   - When designing standard cells, it’s important to consider:
     - Input and output ports should align with the intersections of vertical and horizontal tracks.
     - The width of the standard cell should be an odd multiple of the track pitch, and its height an odd multiple of the vertical track pitch.

3. **LEF File Extraction:**
   - For further steps, you'll need to extract the LEF (Library Exchange Format) file for the Inverter cell.
   - This file provides vital information needed for the place-and-route (PNR) process.

4. **Understanding Tracks:**
   - Review the `tracks.info` file to get details about the horizontal and vertical tracks available on each metal layer.
   - This file includes information on pitch, spacing, and other factors critical for efficient routing.

### Generating LEF Files

To generate LEF files from the layout, follow these steps:

1. **Write LEF File**:
   In the `tkcon` window, execute the following command to write the LEF file:
    
         lef write
    
2. **Update Configuration**:
   Edit the `config.tcl` file to:
   - Change the library file as needed.
   - Add the new LEF file to the OpenLane flow.

   Update the `config.tcl file as follows:

```tcl
